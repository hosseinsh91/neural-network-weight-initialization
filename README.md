# neural-network-weight-initialization
This project trains a deep learning model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. It explores the impact of weight initialization on training performance and demonstrates why setting all initial weights to zero prevents learning. The model consists of two hidden layers with 50 neurons each .
